 ## Motive behind this project /  why i started building this project .
 When I started my engineering studies, I bought textbooks for my first semester like everyone else. But I hardly ever used them except during exams. Our teachers mostly taught from different books, so mine ended up gathering dust.

After my first semester exams, I realized something important: a lot of the questions were similar to what we'd covered in class, not from the whole textbook. So, for the next semester, I decided not to buy any textbooks and used PDF versions instead. Many of my classmates did the same.

Finding the right PDFs online was tough, though. We had to hunt through college WhatsApp groups or search Google, which was frustrating and time-consuming. I often wished there was a website where we could find everything we needed in one place.

That's when it hit me: Why wait for someone else to make it? Engineers are problem solvers, right? So, I decided to create EngineersBooksHubâ€”a place where engineering students can easily get all their study materials without all the hassle.

It's not just about textbooks; it's about helping each other out and making learning easier for everyone. Together, we can build a community where knowledge is shared freely and everyone has the tools they need to succeed.
